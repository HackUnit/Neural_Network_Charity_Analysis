## Overview of the analysis:
Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is well defined

Using machine learning and neural networks, a binary classifier will be created utilizing a dataset from Alphabet Soup that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results:
Using bulleted lists that answers all six questions and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
